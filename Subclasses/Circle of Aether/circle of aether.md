# 2nd level

## Knowledge of dreams

As you you enter this subclass the deepest of dreams brings you the images of three objects.

Choose 3 common magic items from the magic item list, you gain knowledge of their name and how they look.

## Dream shaper

As a bonus action you may expend one use of your wild shape and compact the aether surrounding you into a physical object, choose any object or magical item that has a common rarity of which you know the name and you have seen, you make it appear in any part of your person or within 30ft. of you.

A non magical item disapears after 1 round has passed, and the magical item at the end of your turn. If the item would summon any creatures they may have a turn inmediatly after your turn, and disapear after taking their actions. You don't require attunment to use the item.

If you choose an object that works as a container, you may choose to only create the objects within it. Such as a "Bag of Marbles" you may instead summon just the marbles within the range of the ability.

## Ability two

Once everyday when you do a long rest the barrier between you and the dream world becomes weaker. As you rest you may bring an object to the dream realm with you. You may ask the DM one of the following questions: Why? Who? When? How? Where? The object is consumed after you wake up.

The DM has the option to answer you directly in your dream, the information can be as misterious as DM may please. The DM may also choose to exchange the object in question from another one. If a player ask the same question again the same response or object is given.
