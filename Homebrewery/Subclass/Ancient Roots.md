## Way of the Ancient Roots

### Monastic tradition (level 3)

Monks who follow the way of the Ancient Roots understand that Ki is not an exclusive thing to monks, every living organism has Ki flowing trough them, from a small flower to an gigant owlbear. All monks can stop the flow of Ki in other creatures, such as with the Stunning Strike technic, but only the Ancient Roots allows the monk to use its Ki to interact with anothers creatures flow and see some *grow*.


<div class='descriptive'>

*"Some call my control of Ki magical, i don't see the magic in watering the plants of the temple. You can do this damn job if you want. I'm already to old to be henching my back this much."*

<br/>
*- Rembras Triadona*
</div>


#### Spellcasting

Sometimes a punch can cast magic, who saw that coming?

#### Spellcasting ability

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your monk spells. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a monk spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

<br/>

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

#### Spellcasting Focus

You may use plants or fungi as your focus for spells, we call this a *Plant Focus* to simplify. A *Plant Focus* works simiraly to a magical focus with a catch. As you touch a plant you may choose to cast a spell right from where your hand is touching the plant or from another part of the plant/fungi, a distant branch, exposed roots, unblosomed flowers, etc...

Using this feature you may extend the range of your cantrips and Flow Technics trough the body of the *Plant Focus*, up to a 150ft maximum.

A plant focus may be: seeds, spores, mushrooms, small plants, bushes, trees, etc...


#### Magic Stick & Cantrips

At 3rd level you gain knowledge of the *Monk's Shillelagh* cantrip and two more cantrips from the druid spell list. 

You may change your cantrips every time you level up on this class.


#### Flow Technics

Your understanding of Ki flow has reached a point that allows you to make more than grow small flowers. You learn Flow Technics which allow you to mold plants in ways you would have never imagined.

Flow Technics are a mix of spellcasting and battle maneuvers, this mix allows for a tactital deployment of magical plants against enemies.

Flow Technics require a Plant Focus to cast. Technics share some rules with spells, for example some require concentration and all are affected by spells such as dispel magic and counterpell dispelling any plant creation. When in doubt use the spellcasting rules.

#### Technic Stacking 

Some technics can be stacked which means that can be casted mutiple times in the same action.

Example: You may want to hit a creature 60Ft. from you using a 30ft. range technic (Extending Vines). You will be able to hit it if you stack the technic: Using 2 Ki but only 1 bonus action.

Technics that can be stacked will have the 'Stackable' property and can be done so up to a maximum equal to your wisdom modifier per action.

#### Flow Begginer
You learn *Entangle* and *Extending Vines* from the Flow Technics list.


### Monastic tradition (level 6)
#### Fury of Sticks

You may now use a weapon created wih *Monk's Shillelagh* instead of unarmed strikes when you hit with Fury of Blows and if you used a flow technic as your action you may use fury of blows as your bonus action.

#### Aprentice of Flow

You learn *Dust Mushroom*, *Beetlebomber's Fire Flowers*, *Fruity Explotion* and *Caltrops's Spines* from the Flow Technics list.


### Monastic tradition (level 11)

#### Green Foot

You gain the ability to move freely along plant surfaces. You may end your turn on a vertical or paralel surface to the ground (Heads down) position, you will not fall as plants grab your body and keep it in place.

#### Master of Flow

You learn *Cultivate*, *Leaf Baloon*, *Green Fist* and *Wall of Plants* from the Flow Technics list.

### Monastic tradition (level 17)
#### Flow Expert

You learn *Ancient Flow* and *Last Meal* from the Flow Technics list.

### Some last words

Thanks to my dudes, may the kindom of *Vervesh & Filkiati* be a prosperous and lasting one. <3

<br>

>##### DM notes and flavor
>
> * 'Casting' trough magical plants may present the player with unforeseen magical effects.
> * Giving your player magical plants instead of weapons may be an interesting idea to explore.
> * A player may try to 'make' it's weapon, i do recommend you and the player read a bit about "Plant grafting".
> * Open battles with grass on the ground present this subclass with an unparalleled range at such low levels (210ft. if you use Caltrops's Spines), this may become a headache or a way for players to express their creativity.

<div style='margin-top:80px'></div>

>##### Some small rules
>
> * After casting a plant, it lays there until it dies. As long as the plant has sun, water and good soil it will not die. 
> * A player using *Extending Vines* can create a 'plant web' this can extend vertically in walls. This allows diferrent angles of attack and allows vertical mobility.
> * *Wall of Plants* creates a lot of space between you and the enemy, and maybe you a enemy may try to break them. I recommend using this stats: 15 AC, each cube has 12 hit points, vulnerable to fire.
