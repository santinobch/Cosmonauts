## Way of the Ancient Roots

<div style='margin-top:20px'></div>


### Monastic tradition (level 3)

Monks who follow the Way of the Ancient Roots have learned from studying the simplest organisms, plants and fungi. And trough their studies they managed to control the flow of Ki in other beings.

One may hold a seed of a fruit in the morning and go to sleep with a full harvest, this is the way we walk.

<div style='margin-top:10px'></div>


#### Spellcasting

{{descriptive
*"Some call my control of Ki magical, i don't see the magic in watering the plants of the temple. You can do this damn job if you want. I'm already to old to be henching my back this much."*

	
<div style="text-align: right">
-Rembras Triadona
</div>
}}

#### Preparing and Casting Spells

You prepare the list spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from your **Ancient Roots Spells List**.

When you do so, choose a number of spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your monk level rounded down (minimum of two spells).

<br>

You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a short rest or long rest.

#### Spellcasting ability

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your monk spells. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a monk spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a monk spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

<br/>


<div style="text-indent: 1em">
**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
</div>

<div style="text-indent: 1em">
**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
</div>


#### Spellcasting Focus

To cast your monk spells you may use a *Plant Focus*, it can be anything that it's a plant or fungi as long as it is alive.

<div style='margin-top:170px'></div>
<br/>
<div style='margin-top:230px'></div>


#### Ki Casting

To cast your spells you use your Ki. The cost of a spell is equal to 1 Ki per spell level and will is detailed on the *Ancient Roots Spells List*.


#### Ki Upcasting
When you cast a spell using Ki, you can spend additional Ki points to increase the spell level. To increase the spell level by 1, add the base Ki cost to the total cost of the spell. You may do this any number of times up to a 9th level spell.

 For example, if you cast "Wall of Plants", you can spend 6 Ki points to cast it as a 4th-level spell (the spells's base cost of 3 ki plus 3 ki for the upcast).


#### Magic Arts

When rolling for the damage of a monk spell you may replace the dice by your *martial arts dice*. For example if you were to roll *3d6 damage* and your *martial arts dice* is a d8 you may choose to deal *3d8 damage*.
 
#### Spell-Fueled Attack 
***Optional Feature, requires Ki-Fueled Attack (TCE p48)***

If you cast a spell part of your action on your turn, you can make one attack with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon as a bonus action before the end of the turn.


#### Plant Bender
***Optional Feature***

As long as you are touching a focus, you may choose to cast a spell from any of it's surfaces, distant branches, roots, flowers, etc... are valid up to a range of 60ft. *Spells that consume materials* also can be cast from any point of the focus, but you still require the materials.

You may use your wisdom modifier for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks of this weapon. 

The staff is considered alive and a *plant focus*. The staff instantly rots if you use this ability again, it's dispelled or dies.

<div style='margin-top:10px'></div>

Your magical staff damage increases when you reach 5th level (1d8), 11th level (1d10), and 17th level (1d12).

Creatures or magic items can't be created or transmuted by this spell. You also can't use it to create items that ordinarily require a high degree of craftsmanship, such as weapons or armor, unless you have proficiency with the type of artisan's tools used to craft such objects.

#### Summon Green Fist
*4-th level conjuration*


**Casting Time:**   :: 1 bonus action
**Range:**          :: 5ft.
**Components:**     :: S, M (A hard piece of wood or hard mushroom cap)
**Duration:**       :: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You call forth a ***Green Fist*** made of veiny wood, roots and leaves. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. After the cast you may immediately use the ***Green Fist's Nature's Force*** multiattack and move it up to 30ft (in whichever order your want).

In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. You may command the creature attacks and movement using your bonus action.

The creature is an ally to you and your companions. It obeys your verbal commands (bonus action required). If you don't issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger. The creature rots when it drops to 0 hit points. When the spell ends the creature transforms into vegetation if it's still alive.

<div style='margin-top:10px'></div>

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, use the higher level wherever the spell's level appears in the stat block.

#### Wall of Plants
*3-rd level transmutation*

**Casting Time:**   :: 1 action
**Range:**          :: 60ft.
**Components:**     :: V, S, M (A handful of branches or stems)
**Duration:**       :: Instant


A magical wall of living mush and branches springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is composed of ten 10, 5ft cubes. Each cube must be contiguous with at least one other cube. Alternatively, you can create 20 half-cubes (2.5ft x 5ft. x 5ft).

If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.

***Nature's Force.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* *Str + PB* to hit, reach 5 ft., one target you can see. 

2d8 + *Str* magic bludgeoning damage. For each spell level above 4th add 1d8 to the damage formula.
}}

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can't occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn't need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing cubes or ground to not fall. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.

If you create a span greater than 40 feet in length, you must create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.


The wall is an object made of living mush and branches that can be damaged and thus breached. Each cube has AC 12 and 40 hit points. Each half-cube has AC 12 and 20 hit points. The wall is vulnerable to fire damage. Reducing a cube or half-cube to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected cubes to collapse at the DM's discretion.

<br/>

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you may add 10 more plant cubes or 20 half-cubes to the wall, up to a maximum of 30 cubes or 60 half-cubes.

### Multiclassing

<div style='margin-top:10px'></div>

- When determining your caster level you may treat this class as a third-caster but receive no extra spell slots from it.

### Autor's Notes & Other Things

<div style='margin-top:10px'></div>

- After casting a plant, it lays there until it dies. As long as the plant has sun, water and good soil it will not die. 

- Casting trough magical plants may present the player with unforeseen magical effects.
	
- Giving your player magical plants instead of weapons may be an interesting idea to explore.
	
- A player may try to 'make' it's weapon, i do recommend you and the player read a bit about "Plant grafting".

- For the moment all spells in this pdf are only for this subclass, you can add some of them to the druid spell list if you really want.


### Small Optional Rullings

<div style='margin-top:10px'></div>

- The spell ***"Wall of Plants"*** can create the cube beneath your feet, anf if you use ***"Plant Bending"*** on the cube itself you can repeat this process, creating a cube beneath a cube beneath a cube. This propels you up.

- A cube from ***"Wall of Plants"*** weights about 300 kilograms or 660 pounds and a half-cube half of that, 150 kilograms or 330 pounds.

- To simplify: if you have at least 16 Wisdom score ***Green Fist*** can carry one cube while *Heavily Encumbered* and a half-cube while *Encumbered*


### Some last words

<div style='margin-top:10px'></div>

Thanks to my dudes <3

# Expanding the Core Rules

This subclass was thinked at the time with a theme of plants and the control of nature, but there is nothing stopping you to use the core of this subclass and change the theme.

#### Monk Subclass Creation

I'm going to make a new subclass using this one as a template and I'm going to choose a "four elements" theme.

#### Lv3

- Spellcasting Focus: Your focus can be, ice, volcanic rock, conductive metals, literally acid.
- Plant Bender: this subclass does not have this feature
- Living Weapon: You can make your living weapon out of acid, ice, fire or electricity. Your attacks with your living weapon do elemental damage of the choosen type.
- Cantrips: instead of two driud cantrips, choose two from a list composed of cantrips that deal: acid, cold, fire or lighting damage.

#### Lv9

- Green Foot: this subclass does not have this feature

#### Lv17

- Acient Tools Of Soil: Change the name to "Primordial Form", change the free spells you can cast to any of level 1 as long is a monk spell.

# Testing

This supplement was tested by playing **"Curse of Strad"**, for our setting we used rules from supplements up to *"Tasha's Cauldron of Everything"*. 

It is my intention to play this subclass as normally as i can, without min maxing. I will not multiclass.

<br/>

In our game we banned some spells that came after the initial *PHB* spells, the DM was trying to have a very vanilla campaign. No spells were banned from this subclass.

We only played vanilla races from the *PHB*, i choosed a ***Wood Elf*** for my character. We used point buy for character creation, *TCE* ability score swapping was not allowed.

##### Test Character initial Ability Scores
| 		Ability 	| 	Score 	|
|:-------------:|:----------|
| Strength      | 8 (-1)    |
| Dexterity     | 14 (+2)   |
| Constitution  | 14 (+2)   |
| Intelligence  | 12 (+1)   |
| Wisdom   			| 16 (+3)   |
| Charisma   		| 13 (+1)   |

My background was *Acolyte*, my proficient skills were: *Acrobatics, Stealth, Religion, Insight and Perception*. 

I also picked a tool proficiency from the Monk class, after everyone in the table was astonished that "Herbalism Kit" was not an Artisian Tool, my DM allowed me to pick it, it makes a great fit for the subclass thematically.

<br/>

The other two players choose to play a **Bard** (College of Glamour) and a **Tamer** (Homebrew, see Heliana's Guide to Monster Hunting).

#### Sesion 0 notes

No remarks.

#### Sesion 1 notes

After a social encounter with strad (arm dislocated, lung perforated) we leveled up to level 3, next sesion i can finally start testing. I choosed *Druidcraft* and *Frostbite* for my cantrips.

<br/>

Updated to 1.11 after this sesion.

#### Sesion 2 notes

We arrived to the city Vallaki at the end of th sesion, leveling up to level 5.

I have used the spells *extending vines*, *entangle* and *frostbite*. *Extending vines* works great, had an encounter with a vampaire spawn, it was very handy to stop him from moving.

We had two encounters, the first was two druids and two berserkers. The second one was a druid and 16 wolves. It all seems pretty balanced at the moment.

<br/>

I realised the level 6 ability *Fury of Sticks* was not poperlly worded, fixed that. Also this subclass didn't prepare spells before this update, that was weird, as it had as many spells prepared as a full caster. Updated to 1.12.

### Game Min Maxing

Here are some thoughts about how this sublclass can sinergise with other features.

#### Battle Master / Maneuvers

This subclass focuses on a utility oriented monk, adding maneuvers is always a plus for any martial subclass either from multiclassing or feats. **I don't see this to be unbalanced**.

#### Caster multiclassing

We only have two options if we are using point buy *Driud* or *Cleric*. 

**In general.** I don't see *"Plant Bender"* with it's added 60ft. of range affecting play, that being said adding range to touch spells may create some shenanigans. Having access more spell slots does not appear to affect play.

**Druid.** I don't see this subclass benefiting much from the base class abilities.

*Circle of the Spores* seems to be the most apropiate for multiclassing with it's added *1d6* of damage to melee weapon attacks, while also being in theme. 

The *Sheperd Circle* may be good with it's *Bear Spirit* totem giving you temporary HP.

<br/>

**Cleric.** I don't see this subclass benefiting much from the base class abilities.

I found three subclasses that would be interesting to multiclass: *Peace Domain, Tempest Domian and Twilight Domain*.

*Peace Domain* gives quite good utility spells and the *"Emboldening Bond"* ability is good for an ambush.

*Tempest Domain* gives you more damaging spells and something to do with your reaction: moar damage.

*Twilight Domain*: I know tables that **ban** this subclass, the second level ability of *1d6 temporary HP* every turn, without concentration is strong and you can also end the *charmed* and *frightned* condition of any creature in the area. Indeed very strong.

#### Feats

- Crusher
- Fighting Initiate: Superior Technic
- Martial Adept: Any two maneuvers, one that deals damage.

#### Posible build

- Any number of levels in this subclass you wish.
- At least two levels in Druid, Circle of Spores, can be more.
- Two levels in Cleric, Tempest Domain.
- Maybe grab the *Martial Adept* Feat.




**Level 10th build.**

Monk, Way of the Ancient Roots, 6 levels.

Druid, Circle of Spores, 4 levels.

<br/>

As a starter, you activate *Symbiotic Entity* (Druid), this strategy works better on an ambush due to you having to "waste" you action and wait for next turn.

On the next turn you can do 4 attacks using *Fury of Blows*, lets suppose our PC has maxed wisdom, this means they can do 4 * (1d8 + 1d6 + 5), and we can add 2d6 with maneuvers, giving us 59 average damage. 

For a comparasion a rogue can make about 28 damage at that level with a rapier.



Except for the increased damage of fury of blows (a d8 instead of a d6) this is the damage any monk can do if they multiclass into druid. Lets do a higher level build.

<br/>

**Level 15th Build.**

Monk, Way of the Ancient Roots, 11 levels.

Druid, Circle of Spores, 4 levels.

<br/>

We want acces to "Summon Green Fist" as it has decent damage. Let's add the Green fist to our calculations:

<br/>

2 * (1d10 + 1d6 + 5) + 2 * (2d10 + 5) + 2d6 = **67 Average damage**

<br/>

It's a bit more, but not by a lot, by upcasting green fist to level 5 we can reach **78 average damage**, but we limit anything else we can do in battle, as we are only left with 3 Ki points.

But we can consistently deal this damage, minus the maneuvers, as we are not wasting resources. Dealing an average of **71 Damage** on subsequent turns.

<br/>

A caster can consistently deal 40+ damage by upcasting fireball to a group of creatures.

#### Conclusion

Multiclassing does not seem unbalanced.
