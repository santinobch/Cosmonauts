## Way of the Ancient Roots

### Monastic tradition (level 3)

Monks who follow the Way of the Ancient Roots think Ki is not an exclusive thing to monks, every living organism has Ki flowing trough them, from a small flower to a gigant owlbear. All monks can stop the flow of Ki in other creatures, such as with the Stunning Strike technic, but only the Ancient Roots allows the monk to use its Ki to interact with anothers creatures flow and see some *grow*.

#### Spellcasting

>*"Some call my control of Ki magical, i don't see the magic in watering the plants of the temple. You can do this damn job if you want. I'm already to old to be henching my back this much."*

#### Spellcasting ability

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your monk spells. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a monk spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a monk spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

<br/>

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

#### Spellcasting Focus

To cast your monk spells you may use a *Plant Focus*, it can be anything that it's a plant or fungi as long as it is alive.

#### Plant Bender
***Optional Feature***

As long as you are touching a focus, you may choose to cast a spell from any of it's surfaces, distant branches, roots, flowers, etc... are valid up to a range of 60ft. *Spells that consume materials* also can be cast from any point of the focus, but you still require the materials.

#### Ki Casting

As a monk you don't have spell slots you instead use your Ki. The cost is equal to 1 Ki per spell slot level and will be detailed on the **Ancient Roots Spells List**.

#### Ki Upcasting

You can spend additional ki points to increase the level of some spells. The spell's level increases by 1 for each time you add the spell's ki cost to the casting. For example, if you cast "Wall of Plants", you can spend 4 ki points to cast it as a 3rd-level spell (the spells's base cost of 2 ki two times).


#### Spell-Fueled Attack 
***Optional Feature, requires Ki-Fueled Attack (TCE p48)***

If you cast a spell part of your action on your turn, you can make one attack with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon as a bonus action before the end of the turn.

#### Living Weapon

As and action you may touch a plant or fungi, it grows in interaction with your Ki into a quarterstaff that does 1d6 bludgeoning damage. It has the *Finesse* and *Light* properties.

You may use your wisdom modifier for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks of this weapon. 

The staff is considered alive. The staff rots if you use this ability again, it's dispelled or dies.

Your magical staff damage increases when you reach 5th level (1d8), 11th level (1d10), and 17th level (1d12).



### Monastic tradition (level 6)

#### Wall of Plants
*2-nd level transmutation*

**Casting Time:**   1 action

**Range:**          60ft.

**Components:**     V, S, M (A handful of roots or mycelium)

**Duration:**       Instant

A magical wall of living mush and branches springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is composed of ten 10, 5ft cubes. Each cube must be contiguous with at least one other cube. Alternatively, you can create 20 half-cubes (2.5ft x 5ft. x 5ft).

If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.

The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can't occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn't need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing cubes or ground to not fall. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.

If you create a span greater than 40 feet in length, you must create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.

The wall is an object made of living mush and branches that can be damaged and thus breached. Each cube has AC 12 and 40 hit points. Each half-cube has AC 12 and 20 hit points. The wall is vulnerable to fire damage. Reducing a cube or half-cube to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected cubes to collapse at the DM's discretion.

<br/>

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you may add 10 more plant cubes or 20 half-cubes to the wall, up to 40 cubes or 80 half-cubes.


#### Last Meal
*3-rd level evocation*

**Casting Time:**   1 action
**Range:**          30ft.
**Components:**     V, S, M (1 pound of spores dust, which is consumed)
**Duration:**       instant

You throw a bag of spores to a creature in range of the spell from you, make a range or melee spell attack (your choosing). You try to manifest a medium mushroom on the creature's body. 


On a hit the creature takes 3d10 magic necrotic damage. Either if it hits or misses the creature must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC, on a fail it becomes stunned till the beginning of your next turn and gains one level of *Exhaustion*. 



### Multiclassing

- You may use the **Ki Casting** feature to cast spells from any other source (race, class, feat, etc). 

- You may also use **Ki Upcasting** to upcast spells from other sources (race, class, feat, etc). 

- You can not pay the base cost of a spell with spell slots and the upcast with **Ki Upcasting**.

### Autor's Notes & Other Things

- After casting a plant, it lays there until it dies. As long as the plant has sun, water and good soil it will not die. 

- Casting trough magical plants may present the player with unforeseen magical effects.
	
- Giving your player magical plants instead of weapons may be an interesting idea to explore.
	
- A player may try to 'make' it's weapon, i do recommend you and the player read a bit about "Plant grafting".

- For the moment all spells in this pdf are only for this subclass, you can add some of them to the druid spell list if you really want.


### Small Optional Rullings

- The spell ***"Wall of Plants"*** can create the cube beneath your feet, anf if you use ***"Plant Bending"*** on the cube itself you can repeat this process, creating a cube beneath a cube beneath a cube. This propels you up.

- A cube from ***"Wall of Plants"*** weights about 300 kilograms or 660 pounds and a half-cube half of that, 150 kilograms or 330 pounds.

- To simplify: if you have at least 16 Wisdom score ***Green Fist*** can carry one cube while *Heavily Encumbered* and a hal-cube while *Encumbered*


### Some last words

Thanks to my dudes <3
