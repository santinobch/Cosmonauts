## Way of the Ancient Roots

### Monastic tradition (level 3)

Monks who follow the way of the Ancient Roots understand that Ki is not an exclusive thing to monks, every living organism has Ki flowing trough them, from a small flower to an gigant owlbear. All monks can stop the flow of Ki in other creatures, such as with the Stunning Strike technic, but only the Ancient Roots allows the monk to use its Ki to interact with anothers creatures flow and see some *grow*.


<div class='descriptive'>

*"Some call my control of Ki magical, i don't see the magic in watering the plants of the temple. You can do this damn job if you want. I'm already to old to be henching my back this much."*

<br/>
*- Rembras Triadona*
</div>


#### Spellcasting

Sometimes a punch can cast magic, who saw that coming?

#### Spellcasting ability

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your monk spells. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a monk spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a monk spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

<br/>

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier


#### Spellcasting Focus

You may use plants or fungi as your focus for spells, we call this a *Plant Focus* to simplify. A *Plant Focus* works simiraly to a magical focus with a catch. As you touch a plant you may choose to cast a spell right from where your hand is touching the plant or from another part of the plant/fungi, a distant branch, exposed roots, unblosomed flowers, etc...

Using this feature you may extend the range of your spells trough the body of the *Plant Focus*, up to a 150ft maximum.

A plant focus may be: seeds, spores, mushrooms, small plants, bushes, trees, etc...

#### Spell Slots & Upcasting

As a monk you don't have spell slots you instead use your ki. The ki cost will be detailed on every spell you are able to learn (See list below).


If you want to upcast a monk spell you know, you may do it by adding the Ki cost of the spell one time per upcast. Example: You want to upcast *extending vines* which cost 1 Ki. To upcast it one time you may use 2 Ki total, to do a second upcast you may expend 3 Ki total.


<div style='margin-top:170px'></div>
<br/>

<div style='margin-top:250px'></div>




#### Magic Stick & Cantrips

At 3rd level you gain knowledge of the *Monk's Shillelagh* cantrip and two more cantrips from the druid spell list.

#### Flow Begginer
You add *Barkskin (Source: PHB, 1 Ki)*, *Entangle (Source: PHB, 1 Ki)* and *Extending Vines (1 Ki)* to your know spell list.


### Monastic tradition (level 6)
#### Fury of Sticks

You may now use a weapon created wih *Monk's Shillelagh* instead of unarmed strikes when you hit with Fury of Blows and if you used a spell as your action you may use fury of blows as your bonus action.

#### Aprentice of Flow

You add  *Beetlebomber's Fire Flowers  (2 Ki)*, *Caltrops's Spines (1 Ki)*, *Fruity Explotion (2 Ki)*, *Spike Growth (Source: PHB, 2 Ki)* and *Wolf Dust Mushroom (2 Ki)* to your know spell list.



### Monastic tradition (level 11)

#### Green Foot

You gain the ability to move freely along plant surfaces. You may end your turn on a vertical or paralel surface to the ground (Heads down) position, you will not fall as plants grab your body and keep it in place.

#### Master of Flow

You add *Cultivate (1 Ki)*, *Leaf Baloon (1 Ki)*, *Green Fist (3 Ki)* and *Wall of Plants (2 Ki)* to your know spell list.

### Monastic tradition (level 17)

### DM Notes & Other Things


- Casting trough magical plants may present the player with unforeseen magical effects.
	
- Giving your player magical plants instead of weapons may be an interesting idea to explore.
	
- A player may try to 'make' it's weapon, i do recommend you and the player read a bit about "Plant grafting".
	
- After casting a plant, it lays there until it dies. As long as the plant has sun, water and good soil it will not die. 





<div style='margin-top:410px'></div>




### Some last words

Thanks to my dudes, may the kindom of *Vervesh & Filkiati* be a prosperous and lasting one. <3
