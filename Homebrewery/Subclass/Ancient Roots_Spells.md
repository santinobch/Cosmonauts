### DM Notes & Other Things


- Casting trough magical plants may present the player with unforeseen magical effects.
	
- Giving your player magical plants instead of weapons may be an interesting idea to explore.
	
- A player may try to 'make' it's weapon, i do recommend you and the player read a bit about "Plant grafting".
	
- After casting a plant, it lays there until it dies. As long as the plant has sun, water and good soil it will not die.
