## Way of the Ancient Roots

<div style='margin-top:20px'></div>


### Monastic tradition (level 3)

Monks who follow the Way of the Ancient Roots have learned from studying the simplest organisms, plants and fungi. And trough their studies they managed to control the flow of Ki in other beings.

One may hold a seed of a fruit in the morning and go to sleep with a full harvest, this is the way we walk.

<div style='margin-top:10px'></div>


#### Spellcasting

{{descriptive
*"Some call my control of Ki magical, i don't see the magic in watering the plants of the temple. You can do this damn job if you want. I'm already to old to be henching my back this much."*

	
<div style="text-align: right">
-Rembras Triadona
</div>
}}


#### Spellcasting ability

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your monk spells. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a monk spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a monk spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

<br/>


<div style="text-indent: 1em">
**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
</div>

<div style="text-indent: 1em">
**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
</div>



#### Spellcasting Focus

To cast your monk spells you may use a *Plant Focus*, it can be anything that it's a plant or fungi as long as it is alive.

As long as you are touching a focus, you may choose to cast a spell from any of it's surfaces, distant branches, roots, flowers, etc... are valid up to a range of 60ft. *Spells that consume materials* also can be cast from any point of the focus, but you still require the materials.


#### Ki Casting

As a monk you don't have spell slots you instead use your Ki. The cost is equal to 1 Ki per spell level and will be detailed on the **Ancient Roots Spells List**.



<div style='margin-top:170px'></div>
<br/>
<div style='margin-top:230px'></div>



#### Ki Upcasting
When you cast a spell you can spend additional ki points to increase the spell level. To increase the spell level by 1, add the base Ki cost to the total cost of the spell. You may do this any number of times up to a 9th level spell.

 For example, if you cast "Wall of Plants", you can spend 4 ki points to cast it as a 3rd-level spell (the spells's base cost of 2 ki plus 2 ki for the upcast).

The staff is considered alive. The staff instantly rots if you use this ability again, it's dispelled or dies.

#### Wall of Plants
*2-nd level transmutation*

**Casting Time:**   :: 1 action
**Range:**          :: 60ft.
**Components:**     :: V, S, M (A handful of roots or mycelium)
**Duration:**       :: Instant


A magical wall of living mush and branches springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is composed of ten 10, 5ft cubes. Each cube must be contiguous with at least one other cube. Alternatively, you can create 20 half-cubes (2.5ft x 5ft. x 5ft).

If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.












\page

The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can't occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn't need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing cubes or ground to not fall. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.


If you create a span greater than 40 feet in length, you must create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.


The wall is an object made of living mush and branches that can be damaged and thus breached. Each cube has AC 12 and 40 hit points. Each half-cube has AC 12 and 20 hit points. The wall is vulnerable to fire damage. Reducing a cube or half-cube to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected cubes to collapse at the DM's discretion.

<br/>

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you may add 10 more plant cubes or 20 half-cubes to the wall, up to 40 cubes or 80 half-cubes.

#### Great Tree
*4-th level transmutation*

**Casting Time:**   :: 1 bonus action
**Range:**          :: Self
**Components:**     :: V
**Duration:**       :: Concentration, up to 1 minute

Your skin appears barky, leaves sprout from your hair, and you gain the following benefits:
- You gain 10 temporary hit points.
- You make Constitution saving throws with advantage.
- You make Dexterity- and Wisdom-based attack rolls with advantage.
- While you are on the ground, the ground within 15 feet of you is difficult terrain for your enemies.



#### Last Meal
*3-rd level evocation*

**Casting Time:**   :: 1 action
**Range:**          :: 30ft.
**Components:**     :: V, S, M (1 pound of spores dust, which is consumed)
**Duration:**       :: instant

You throw a bag of spores to a creature in range of the spell from you, make a range or melee spell attack (your choosing). You try to manifest a medium size mushroom inside the creature's body, pulsating and devouring.

On a hit the creature takes 3d10 magic necrotic damage. Either if it hits or misses the creature must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC, on a fail it becomes stunned till the beginning of your next turn and gains one level of *Exhaustion*, to a maximum of 3 levels of *Exhaustion*. 

<!--
#### Mouth of the Garden

### Multiclassing

<div style='margin-top:10px'></div>

- When determining your caster level you may treat this class as a third-caster but receive no extra spell slots from it.

- You may only use the **Ki Casting** & **Ki Upcasting** features to cast and upcast spells from any other source (race, class, feat, etc) if your total level as a caster would give you access to those spells. 

- You can not pay the base cost of a spell with spell slots and the upcast with **Ki Upcasting**.

### Autor's Notes & Other Things

<div style='margin-top:10px'></div>

- After casting a plant, it lays there until it dies. As long as the plant has sun, water and good soil it will not die. 

- Casting trough magical plants may present the player with unforeseen magical effects.
	
- Giving your player magical plants instead of weapons may be an interesting idea to explore.
	
- A player may try to 'make' it's weapon, i do recommend you and the player read a bit about "Plant grafting".

- For the moment all spells in this pdf are only for this subclass, you can add some of them to the druid spell list if you really want.


### Small Optional Rullings

<div style='margin-top:10px'></div>

- The spell ***"Wall of Plants"*** can create the cube beneath your feet, anf if you use ***"Plant Bending"*** on the cube itself you can repeat this process, creating a cube beneath a cube beneath a cube. This propels you up.

- A cube from ***"Wall of Plants"*** weights about 300 kilograms or 660 pounds and a half-cube half of that, 150 kilograms or 330 pounds.

- To simplify: if you have at least 16 Wisdom score ***Green Fist*** can carry one cube while *Heavily Encumbered* and a hal-cube while *Encumbered*

### Testing

This supplement was tested by playing **"Curse of Strad"**, for our setting we used rules from supplements up to *"Tasha's Cauldron of Everything"*. 

It is my intention to play this subclass as normally as i can, without min maxing. I will not multiclass.

<br/>

In our game we banned some spells that came after the initial *PHB* spells, the DM was trying to have a very vanilla campaign. No spells were banned from this subclass.

We only played vanilla races from the *PHB*, i choosed a ***Wood Elf*** for my character. We used point buy for character creation, *TCE* ability score swapping was not allowed.

##### Test Character initial Ability Scores
| 		Ability 	| 	Score 	|
|:-------------:|:----------|
| Strenght      | 8 (-1)    |
| Dexterity     | 14 (+2)   |
| Constitution  | 14 (+2)   |
| Intelligence  | 12 (+1)   |
| Wisdom   			| 16 (+3)   |
| Charisma   		| 13 (+1)   |

My background was *Acolyte*, my proficient skills were: *Acrobatics, Stealth, Religion, Insight and Perception*. 

I also picked a tool proficiency from the Monk class, i choose the "Herbalism Kit" as i saw it would make a great fit for the subclass.

<br/>

The other two players choose to play a **Bard** (College of Glamour) and a **Tamer** (Homebrew, see Heliana's Guide to Monster Hunting).
