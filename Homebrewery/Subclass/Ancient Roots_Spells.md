## Way of the Ancient Roots

<div style='margin-top:20px'></div>


### Monastic tradition (level 3)

Monks who follow the way of the Ancient Roots think Ki is not an exclusive thing to monks, every living organism has Ki flowing trough them, from a small flower to a gigant owlbear. All monks can stop the flow of Ki in other creatures, such as with the Stunning Strike technic, but only the Ancient Roots allows the monk to use its Ki to interact with anothers creatures flow and see some *grow*.

<div style='margin-top:30px'></div>


#### Spellcasting

*"Some call my control of Ki magical, i don't see the magic in watering the plants of the temple. You can do this damn job if you want. I'm already to old to be henching my back this much."*

	
<div style="text-align: right">

<br/>
<div style='margin-top:210px'></div>

Example: *Extending Vines* upcasted at level 2 is 2 Ki, *Wall of Plants* upcasted at level 5 is 4 Ki.

 
#### Spell-Fueled Attack 
***Optional Feature, requires Ki-Fueled Attack (TCE p48)***

### Autor's Notes & Other Things

- After casting a plant, it lays there until it dies. As long as the plant has sun, water and good soil it will not die. 

- Casting trough magical plants may present the player with unforeseen magical effects.
	
- Giving your player magical plants instead of weapons may be an interesting idea to explore.
	
- A player may try to 'make' it's weapon, i do recommend you and the player read a bit about "Plant grafting".

- For the moment all spells in this pdf are only for this subclass, you can add some of them to the druid spell list if you really want.


### Small Optional Rullings

- When using ***"Wall of Plants"*** you can use your movement after placing a cube and then keep placing cubes, the same way you would do it for movement and attacks.

- The spell ***"Wall of Plants"*** can create the cube beneath your feet, anf if you use ***"Plant Bending"*** on the cube itself you can repeat this process, creating a cube beneath a cube beneath a cube. This propels you up.

- A cube from ***"Wall of Plants"*** weights about 300 kilograms or 660 pounds.

- To simplify: if you have at least 16 Wisdom score ***Green Fist*** can carry one cube while *Heavily Encumbered*


### Some last words

Thanks to my dudes <3
