# How does it work?

## Minimum requirements:


***Feats: I recommend only picking Elven accuracy, Lucky and Martial adept (last one being optional).***

Sorcerer any subclass (5 Lvs):
- Needed for spell slots
- Has haste on spell list
- Good combination with warlock (Eldritch smite + Twinned Spell)

Hexblade (12 Lvs):
- Has crit at 19.
- Invocation: Eldritch smite (Lv5 Requirement, Spell Lv x 1d8 Damage) .
- Invocation: Lifedrinker (Lv12 Requirement, +Cha to Damage).

Paladin, Oath of Vengance (3 Lvs):
- Divine Smite (Spell Lv. x 1d8 + 1d8 Damage. Max 5d8, 6d8 against undead).
- Channel Divinity: Vow of Enmity. Bonus action, advantage attacks against choosen enemy, 1 min duration.

Weapon of choice (2 attacks + bonus action):
- Double-bladed scimitar   (2.5 * 5) = 12.5 Average.

### How to use this build:
- First Turn: Cast ***Haste*** on yourself, use **Bonus action** for ***Hexblade curse***, use haste action for attack. We now have 4 attacks per turn and **crits on 19**.
- Second Turn: **If you can get flanking advantage then proceed to full blown attack**, other wise attack normally and use ***Vow of Enmity*** for advantage. Next turn deal full blown attack.

## Full blown attack

  Most of our damage comes from static damage, our Pact Blade does: Cha + 6 (Hexlade Curse) + Cha (Invocation: Lifedrinker) = 16 per attack.

  I lied most of our damage comes from burning spells as smites, i do recommend holding out wasting spells, and instead 'fish' for crits. But you may have a short encounter, in which case you may want to go all out.

  Eldritch Smite? Divine Smite? Well Divine smite obviously always follow the lords path, it has higher dmg base.

  But we have level 5 Spell slots as warlock, which breaks the math, thats why need some levels in a Full Spellcaster class to burn those juicy spell slots.

  **Our character is a level 6 Spell caster + Warlock nonsense.**

  A normal 4 attack turn should look like this, (we already used a 3rd level spell to cast haste):
  
  > 1st DSmite Lv 2 (5d8) + ESmite (5d8)
  > 
  > 2nd DSmite Lv 2 (4d8) + ESmite (5d8)
  > 
  > 3rd DSmite Lv 2 (4d8) + ESmite (5d8)
  > 
  > 4th DSmite Lv 1 (3d8) + ESmite (2d8)

  <br>

  So our Double Bladed Scimitar **BASE** damage would be:

  > 1st DSmite Lv 2 (5d8) + ESmite (5d8) + 2d4 + 16
  > 
  > 2nd DSmite Lv 2 (4d8) + ESmite (5d8) + 2d4 + 16
  > 
  > 3rd DSmite Lv 2 (4d8) + ESmite (5d8) + 2d4 + 16
  > 
  > 4th DSmite Lv 1 (3d8) + ESmite (2d8) + 1d4 + 16
  > 
  > **Total: 230**

  <br>

 **Crit 'Fishing':** Using ***Advantage + Lucky + Elven accuracy*** we can roll 4 times in a single attack, giving us a 1.3439 **Crit chance multiplier** damage in average. Last attack becomes a 1.271 **Crit chance multiplier**.

  > 1st ( DSmite Lv 2 (5d8) + ESmite (5d8) + 2d4 ) x 1.3439 + 16 = 83,195‬
  > 
  > 2nd ( DSmite Lv 2 (4d8) + ESmite (5d8) + 2d4 ) x 1.3439 + 16 = 77,14745
  > 
  > 3rd ( DSmite Lv 2 (4d8) + ESmite (5d8) + 2d4 ) x 1.3439 + 16 = 77,14745
  >  
  > 4th ( DSmite Lv 1 (3d8) + ESmite (2d8) + 1d4 ) x 1.2710 + 16 = 47,775
  > 
  > **Total: 285,2649‬**
  >
  > **With magic item: 297,2649‬**

  <br>

 ## Optionals:

  ### ***Martial Adept*** gives us +2d6 & combat utility, this only affects 2 attacks:

  > 1st ( DSmite Lv 2 (5d8) + ESmite (5d8) + 2d4 + 1d6 ) x 1.3439 + 16 = 87,89865‬
  > 
  > 2nd ( DSmite Lv 2 (4d8) + ESmite (5d8) + 2d4 + 1d6 ) x 1.3439 + 16 = 81,8511‬
  > 
  > 3rd ( DSmite Lv 2 (4d8) + ESmite (5d8) + 2d4 ) x 1.3439 + 16 = 77,14745‬
  > 
  > 4th ( DSmite Lv 1 (3d8) + ESmite (2d8) + 1d4 ) x 1.2710 + 16 = 47,775
  > 
  > **Total: 294,6722‬**
  >
  > **With magic item: 306,6722‬**


  ### With ***GWF*** (Fighting Initiate: Great Weapon Figther) you can reroll 1 & 2 from weapon damage (1,2178‬ chance multiplier):

  > 1st ( DSmite Lv 2 (5d8) + ESmite (5d8) + (2d4 * 1,2178‬) + 1d6 ) x 1.3439 + 16 = 89,3621571‬
  > 
  > 2nd ( DSmite Lv 2 (4d8) + ESmite (5d8) + (2d4 * 1,2178‬) + 1d6 ) x 1.3439 + 16 = 83,4877
  > 
  > 3rd ( DSmite Lv 2 (4d8) + ESmite (5d8) + (2d4 * 1,2178‬) ) x 1.3439 + 16 = 78,6109571‬
  > 
  > 4th ( DSmite Lv 1 (3d8) + ESmite (2d8) + (1d4 * 1,2178‬) ) x 1.2710 + 16 = 48,5067
  > 
  > **Total: 299,9675142**
  >
  > **With magic item: 311,9675142**
